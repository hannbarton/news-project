# News Website
This is a simple web application which fetches news articles from an external api vendor and displays them

### My Application Can:
1. [x] Sign up and login as a user using local-passport.
2. [x] Fetch news articles via news api.
3. [x] Display these news sources as buttons and clicking on them shows the top 10 articles for that news source.
4. [x] The user is able to save articles
5. [ ] There is a button which allows the user to look at the saved articles (Bonus-Points).

There are three views in my application:
1. Login screen.
2. Home screen with clickable buttons to 5 news sources
3. Home screen that shows ten news articles by source and your saved articles.

### Tech Stack Used:
1. Backend - Node.js
2. Frontend - React
3. Database - postgreSQL

## How to get my application running:
1. Register with news api to generate an api-key and get access to thier api. https://newsapi.org/
2. Save the api key within your secrets.js folder in the root of the application and save it as `process.env.NEWS_API_KEY`
3. Create a db called `news-project` in postgreSQL
4. `npm run start-dev`

### My application will:
1. alert you if your email or password is incorrect
2. alert you if you already have an account and you are trying to sign up again with the same email
3. allow you to login and logout
4. allow you to save articles to your account
